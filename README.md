# XOR neural network with Everett activation function

Implementation of a neural network with [Everett activation function](https://pointlander.github.io/posts/everett-activation-function/). The neural network is trained on the xor logic function. When trained with gradient descent the neural network converges nicely. The neural network is tested to be working as an xor function after training.
